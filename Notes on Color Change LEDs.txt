In May 2015 I purchased 3mm and 5mm color change LEDs off eBay.

They're really just RGB leds with a IC to cycle thru the possible colors.

There are slow change and fast change/blink versions.

I have the slow change ones.

They are clear not diffuse!  Arrgh!

This makes them quite bright but the color blends are not very blended at all.

Tried roughing them up with 600 grit sandpaper.  That helps some.

Then added dipping them in hot glue.  That seems to help some more.

One then quit working.  Are they delicate or failure prone?

Varied their driving resistor.  Seems to work over a wide range.  5V supply.  At 1K or below, very bright.

Took the resistor up to 10K.  Continues working.  Above 8K seems to be right for matching brightness of other LEDs being used.
