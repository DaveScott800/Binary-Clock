This project was created as a project for scouts completing the Electronics merit badge under the supervision of a qualified counselor.  So, it was meant to be simple.  Extension of the project (such as adding a method to adjust the time) was purposely left open-ended.

(As built, the start time for the clock is hard-coded in the software at 5:42.  The clock does not indicate AM or PM so this could be either.  Twice a day, if you power up the clock at the right time, it will be correct.  But consequently, if the power is the grid and the power is interrupted, the time will be incorrect.  I?ve found this not to be difficult by setting this a few minutes after the morning alarm clock goes off.)

Other users are welcome to use and modify the project.  I welcome feedback if you successfully build this project and any comments, issues, improvements, etc.

My experience has been that it keeps time well to within seconds per week.  I do not know if this will vary among multiple clocks/builders.  I have adjusted the timing with the number of extra cycles in the software.
